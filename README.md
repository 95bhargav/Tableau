# Demo for creating a Tableau Dashboard.

So the Covid-19 pandemic gave me a chance to learn the visualization software Tableau for free **(yes,you heard it right!!)**. The course itself was provided by Tableau, so there is no dobut about the quality of the material they provied. Here is the link for anyone interested to learn anyways [link](https://www.tableau.com/learn/training/elearning).

Here is a simple demonstration of my learnings from the software to create a Dashboard to show the results of my analysis.

The data-source is directly connected to the workbook.
